# Analysis of News Data During Asset Bubbles.

This repository contains the replication code. Here is a breakdown of the files:
- `analysis_v2` contains the data analysis. The code to replicate the diagrams in the final report are located in the `overval_graphs.ipynb` notebooks within each bubble file. 
- `pysentiment2` is the library I wrote to perform the sentiment analysis. It is adapted from the `pysentiment2` library found [here](https://pypi.org/project/pysentiment2/)
