# Analysis of News Data During Asset Bubbles.

This repository contains the replication code for my summer project, which analyzed news data accumulated during the dot-com and cryptocurrency bubbles. Here is a brief breakdown of the contents of this repository. 
- The final report is titled `final_report`. 
- `analysis_v2` contains the data analysis. The code to replicate the diagrams in the final report are located in the `overval_graphs.ipynb` notebooks within each bubble file. 
- `pysentiment2` is the library used to perform the sentiment analysis. The code in here is a modification of the `pysentiment2` library found here: "https://pypi.org/project/pysentiment2/".
