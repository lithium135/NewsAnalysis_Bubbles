# Analysis of News Data During Asset Bubbles.

This repository contains the replication code for my project that studies news data accumulated during the dot-com and cryptocurrency bubbles. Here is a breakdown of the files found here: 
- The final report is titled `final_report`. 
- `analysis_v2` contains the data analysis. The code to replicate the diagrams in the final report are located in the `overval_graphs.ipynb` notebooks within each bubble file. 
- `pysentiment2` is the library used to perform the sentiment analysis, which is based off the `pysentiment2` library found [here](https://pypi.org/project/pysentiment2/)
